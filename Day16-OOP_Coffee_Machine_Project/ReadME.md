This project is about building a digital coffee machine using object oriented programming. The coffee choices are going to be the same as Day 15 Project which are cappuccino, 
espresso or latte. You can change to other drinks if you are bored of seeing these choices only. Haha. 

This project is part of Day 16 of 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp Course by Angela Yu on Udemy.
