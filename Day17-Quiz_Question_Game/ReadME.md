This project is about building a Quiz Question Game using object oriented programming. 

I have two sets of question data to give some variety for the game, one in data.py file and one in updated_data.py file. You can get more sets of questions online as well on

This project corresponds to Day 17 of 100 Days of Code - The Python Pro Bootcamp course on Udemy by Angela Yu.
