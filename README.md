I am currently undertaking 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp course in Udemy which is taught by Angela Yu. 

I will upload the completed projects in this repository once I am completed with it. I will do my best to keep the days and the codes that I have completed organised. 

I like to improvise a little, so I will try to upload both versions of code - Angela's one and mine for your reference. Obviously, my code version is gonna be more terrible than Angela's 
since she's a pro and I am still a begineer, but I will give it a try. :)
